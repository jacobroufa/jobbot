# /jobbot
## find folks looking for work on yr slack

This bot is originally intended to augment [MWDC's](midwestdevchat.slack.com) #jobopportunities channel, to facilitate finding those looking for work, their skillsets and availability. Eventually will be used to register folks for work maybe? ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Who knows... 

## configuration

Set up env vars `SLACK_VERIFY`, `SLACK_TOKEN`, and `SHEET_TOKEN` to allow your app access to the necessary information.
